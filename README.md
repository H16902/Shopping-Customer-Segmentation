# Mall Customer Segmentation 🧠

This project analyzes mall customer data to understand spending behavior and group similar customers using K-Means clustering.

## Objective
To segment customers into meaningful groups based on **Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score** to support future marketing and business strategy.

## Approach
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer distributions.
- Plotted **histograms and box plots** to find patterns, outliers, and key statistics like mean and median.
- Used **Min–Max scaling** to normalize data before clustering.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**.
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to segment customers into **5 clusters**.
- Interpreted cluster behavior visually to identify different customer types.

## Key Insights
- Customer groups showed clear differences in spending habits and income levels.
- Segmentation can later help design targeted marketing strategies (to be added when project is expanded).

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for histograms, box plots)  
- Scikit-Learn (for scaling and K-Means)

## Dataset
Mall customer dataset containing customer demographics and spending scores.

## Results
Customers were segmented into **5 clusters** based on normalized behavioral patterns.

## Future Scope
- Add cluster profiling with business suggestions
- Build interactive dashboards (Power BI/Tableau)
- Test segments on real marketing hypotheses

This README is simple, structured, and clearly shows analytical steps. It also gives you space to add impact later, which will strengthen your profile for analyst roles. Let me know if you want me to generate the dependency install commands or a folder structure too!
